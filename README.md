# Mnemosyne

## Personal Scheduling Application

The purpose of this application is to simplify
the *creation*, *scheduling*, and *updating*
of events or deadlines, by allowing a user to 
enter a series of errands, a short description, 
and the date each must be completed by. The 
application then sorts them in order from the 
closest due date to the farthest, and allows the 
tasks to be searched using several filters (such 
as due date, description keywords, or title), to 
have any details changed, or marked as completed.
In this way, Mnemosyne can be used by anyone 
who could use some help in keeping track of their
**day-to-day activities**, or for more **long-term
planning** and assistance in **prioritizing tasks**. 
This can be especially helpful to **students**, who 
have frequent small assignments, exams, projects,
and events to keep track of during the school year.
As someone who has used to-do lists, calendars, 
and planners to varying degrees of success throughout
my academic journey, I am highly invested and 
interested in this project, as I want to make 
something that I will ultimately be able to use
later on, and which I believe will be very helpful
in scheduling for several months in advance.
